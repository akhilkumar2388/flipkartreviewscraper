Sanmitra Pardeshi,5,Highly recommended,PerfectionThis is a 50inch model1.Colours are the most accurate in this range(you can customize their saturation and make it look like a samsung tv if you want)2.You should see their Motionflow XR feature in person.

Siva prakasam,1,Not recommended at all,"Product i am using yet to know it's features will give rating only after the few months of usage ,but installation guy was not having the idea about how to do a secure installation plus he doesn't had an idea about what's privacy means,Sony should train it's technicians about how to behave during the time of installation...
